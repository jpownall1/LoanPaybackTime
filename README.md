# LoanPaybackTime
This is a project what will work out the payback time of a student loan with a wage and loan as an argument.
Run the program by typing in the terminal "java RunLoanPaybackCalculator"
The CLI will request two inputs from the user, being the loan and wage. Wage is assumed to be constant over the 30 years.

The program will return a statement. This can be one of two: 
- If you cannot pay off the loan with the inputted wage, it will return the wage you will require.
- If you can, it will return how many years it will take you and how much will be paid per month.
